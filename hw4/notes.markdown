## Notes for posterity.

- Next time, have students submit the code instead of pdf files. Might need to tell them to use `numpy.loadtxt()` on the full `ss12pil.csv` because everyone should be able to run the code to peer review, and if they pre-process the file using Unix tools, other students also would also need to do the pre-processing, which makes it hard to peer grade.
