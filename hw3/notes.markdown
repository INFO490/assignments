## Notes for posterity.

- Most students taking this course will not have any programming experience. The lesson I learned from this is it's impossible to teach programming in two weeks to someone who has never programmed before. If you want to use this assignment, provide much more details and make it easier.

### Problem 1

- Revise so that all number counts start at 0, not 1.
- Some students will import the csv module. In my opinion, this is not optimal, so I would prevent them from importing other modules in the next version.

### Problem 2

-

### Problem 3

- Use `unpack` option in loadtxt. Delete `numpy.transpose()` line in the template.
